USE SCENARIO
1. Seller registers stuff with the anticipated price. </br>
ex) 'A' registers a bike with $30.
2. Customers who want to buy that stuff bet on it. </br>
ex) 'B' pays $5, 'C' pays $2, etc...
3. If the total payment of the customers on that stuff reaches the anticipates price, the 'drawing phase' is started.
Each person who participated in the betting has (personal payment * 100 / total price) % chance to get the stuff. </br>
ex) 'B' has 16.67%, 'C' has 6.67% chance to win the drawing phase.
4. The winner of the 'drawing phase' is decided! He/she gets the stuff, and the seller gets all of the payment. </br>
ex) Miraculously, 'C' was chosen with the 6.67% probability! 'C' gets the bike and 'A' gets the whole money.
